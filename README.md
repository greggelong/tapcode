# tapcode

Last week I had the opportunity to view an  Music and Art performance in Beijing. During this noise art performance, the music emerged from the musicians and some audience participants.  I had a discussion with one of the musicians. He thanked me for participating. I told him I really enjoyed being a part of it, even if I was just banging on a symbol. But he said during the performance he felt like we were communicating. I felt exactly the same way.
That feeling stayed with me and the by Monday my creative coding was informed by this idea.  
I started working with the concept of encoding communication with taping sound and blinks.  Of course a lot of codes like this  already exist, for example Morse code. In these projects I am using something called “Tap Code”.
Tap Code has been used by prisoners in jail to communicate with one another. The method of communicating is usually by "tapping" either the metal bars or the walls inside the cell.  
In the javaScript example live at

I use a blinking box, changing it to a visual code.    I have even encoded some simple words from my students vocabulary, and we will do this as an activity for review next week.
In the physical computing example I am using a servo to make a simple robot arm to tap out a secret message.
